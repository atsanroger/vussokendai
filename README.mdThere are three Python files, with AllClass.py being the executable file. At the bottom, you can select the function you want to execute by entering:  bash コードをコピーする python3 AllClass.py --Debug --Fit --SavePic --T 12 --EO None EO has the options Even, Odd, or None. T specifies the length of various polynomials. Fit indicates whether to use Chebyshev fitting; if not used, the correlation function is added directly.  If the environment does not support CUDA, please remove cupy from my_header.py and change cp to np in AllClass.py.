There are three Python files, with AllClass.py being the executable file. At the bottom, you can select the function you want to execute by entering:

bash
python3 AllClass.py --Debug --Fit --SavePic --T 12 --EO None

EO has the options Even, Odd, or None.
T specifies the length of various polynomials.
Fit indicates whether to use Chebyshev fitting; if not used, the correlation function is added directly.

If the environment does not support CUDA, please remove cupy from my_header.py and change cp to np in AllClass.py.
